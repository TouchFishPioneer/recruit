# Recruit

Redesigned SEU Recruit system.

## Introduction

This system is a redesigned recruit system for SEU undergraduate student enrollment. Even though we have already developed a system (which is running currently), there are some problems in the existing system that need to be improved. Thus, I redesign this system, which is a demo to serve as a blueprint for later reference.

So, what are the problems of the existing system? In other words, what other aspects of the existing system can be improved?

In my humble opinion, the database design should be redesigned with careful consideration. Due to the lack of time, the previous database table structure was rushed online without careful design. In the following operation and maintenance process, with the increasing demand of first-party, we have to modify or add new tables to the database repeatedly, which makes the it increasingly bloated and ugly. Thus, an ideal database design should take full advantage of the previous lessons and pay attention to scalability and robustness.

Secondly, a big problem of the former system is that it has no possibility of horizontal and vertical expansion. The unified implementation of all services and interfaces makes it extremely difficult to split services. In addition, the chaos of application structure also brings great difficulty to the maintenance of later comers. Therefore, in the redesigned system, I will attempt to decompose the application into microservices using the **Spring Cloud** architecture.

## Security Issues

This redesigned system contains no sensible data or information of existing recruit system and its business details. Thus it can be open sourced safely.
